The GROUP BY clause is used in a SELECT statement to group rows into a set of summary 
rows by values of columns or expressions. The GROUP BY clause returns one row per group.

The GROUP BY clause is often used with aggregate functions such as AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), 
MIN() and SUM(). In this case, the aggregate function returns the summary information 
per group. For example, given groups of products in several categories, the AVG() 
function returns the average price of products in each category.

Oracle GROUP BY with an aggregate function example
The following statement returns the number of orders by customers:

SELECT
    customer_id,
    COUNT( order_id )
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY
    customer_id
ORDER BY
    customer_id;

Oracle GROUP BY with an expression example
The following example groups the orders by year and returns the number of orders per year.

SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) YEAR,
    COUNT( order_id )
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)
ORDER BY
    YEAR;

The HAVING clause is an optional clause of the SELECT statement. It is used to filter groups 
of rows returned by the GROUP BY clause. This is why the HAVING clause is usually used with 
the GROUP BY clause.

Simple Oracle HAVING example
The following statement uses the GROUP BY clause to retrieve the orders and their values from the order_items table:

SELECT
    order_id,
    SUM( unit_price * quantity ) order_value
FROM
    order_items
GROUP BY
    order_id
ORDER BY
    order_value DESC;

To find the orders whose values are greater than 1 million, you add a HAVING clause as follows:

SELECT
    order_id,
    SUM( unit_price * quantity ) order_value
FROM
    order_items
GROUP BY
    order_id
HAVING
    SUM( unit_price * quantity ) > 1000000
ORDER BY
    order_value DESC;

Oracle HAVING with complex condition example
You can use a complex filter condition in the HAVING clause to filter groups.

For example, the following statement finds orders whose values are greater than 500,000 and the number of products in each order is between 10 and 12:

SELECT
    order_id,
    COUNT( item_id ) item_count,
    SUM( unit_price * quantity ) total
FROM
    order_items
GROUP BY
    order_id
HAVING
    SUM( unit_price * quantity ) > 500000 AND
    COUNT( item_id ) BETWEEN 10 AND 12
ORDER BY
    total DESC,
    item_count DESC;
